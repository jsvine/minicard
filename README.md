__minicard__ is a bare-bones CSS stylesheet for creating "card"-style elements.

Cards take the following structure:

```html
<div class="minicard">
    <div class="minicard-head">A Title, Perhaps</div>
    <div class="minicard-body">
        Pretty much whatever you want here.
    </div>
    <div class="minicard-foot">A sourceline or fine print.</div>
</div>
```
